\section{Introduction}
In 2006, Professor Herman Tavani wrote that both Information Technology and
genetics will play a critical role in $21^{st}$ century healthcare. As part of
this rapid development, Bioinformatics as a field is exemplary of how
Information Technology is required to collate, analyse and distribute genetic
data \parencite{tavani2006ethics}[Chp.~17].

The abundance of data available in the form of genetic and image data raises
concerns for privacy of individuals. The fact that Informatics has come to
play such a critical role in biomedical research poses problems ethically.
Fields such as Bioethics and Computational ethics have had years to develop
independently.

Hongladarom argues that Bioinformatics poses a whole new paradigm of ethics in
terms of data protection. While data protection measures are in place for the
safe keeping of credit card numbers in order to protect the identity of an
individual, storing a persons full genome or exome sequence adds an additional
challenge in that your genetic sequence is inherently and indelibly part of
your identity \parencite{hongladarom2006ethics}.

This article will expand on some of the ethical challenges that come with
Bioimaging and Bioinformatics with particular attention given to the storing
of data and tissue in Biobanks, followed by a discussion of the ethics of
image manipulation in a scientific context.

v\section{Biobanks}
An important element for successful scientific enquire in the field of
Bioinformatics is the availability of large data sources for processing. The
term `biobank` is a confounding term resulting from a range of different
interpretations, be they the storage of tissue samples, DNA sequence data or
medical images.

An early and comprehensive example of a Biobank took blood samples from the
many Icelandic citizens including data from their medical records. deCODE
genetics is a private biotechnology company from Delaware that was allowed to
gain access to these records following a law passed in the Icelandic parliament
in 1998 \parencite{chadwick1999icelandic}.

These biobanks become an increasingly important part of medical research and 
it can be argued they will become even more relevant with a move towards 
personalised medicine \parencite{watson2010integrating}. An example of this
includes the identification of imatinib for targeting chronic myeloid leukaemia 
in particular subpopulations \parencite{cohen2002approval} as well as in the
application of herceptin in certain breast cancers \parencite{lemieux2009role}.

A number of ethical issues have been raised 
following the decision of the Icelandic parliament. These issues will be 
discussed below.

\subsection{Data protection}
A large proponent of the criticism of the deCODE genetics project is the issue
of informed consent with regard to gaining access to individuals private
medical data.

The Icelandic Government in the case of deCODE project decided that informed 
consent would not be required to collate the medical records and blood samples 
of its citizens because it would be anonymised \parencite{chadwick1999icelandic}.

\emph{The European Directive on the Protection of Personal Data}, officially 
termed 95/46/EC, is a directive issued by the European Union (EU) from 1995 which 
addresses the issue of processing of personal data. Article 8 of this directive 
prohibits the processing of certain types of personal data such as that which 
can reveal the racial or ethnic origin of a person as well as prohibiting the 
processing of data concerning a person's health \parencite{directive199595}.

Exhemptions stated in this directive include seeking the ``explicit consent'' 
of individuals unless a member state of the European Union has laws to override 
this. In this regard, deCODE genetics should, according to the EU directive 
should have regardless of the Icelandic government's laws, seeked the consent of 
the Icelandic citizens \parencite{carey2009data}.

Knowing that this is in fact a legal as well as an ethical issue, Research Ethics 
Committees (RECs) and Institution Review Boards (IRBs) have an important role in 
ensuring that the consent of patients is sought for all material stored in a 
biobank \cite{watson2010integrating}.

\section{Bioimaging}

\subsubsection{Data protection}
Data protection measures that affect medical and personal data should also be 
applied to medical imaging data, knowing that these images are themselves a form 
of personal data \cite{duquenoy2008considering}.
