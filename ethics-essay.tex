\section{Introduction}
In 2006, Professor Herman Tavani wrote that both Information Technology and
genetics will play a critical role in 21^{st} century healthcare. As part of
this rapid development, Bioinformatics as a field is exemplary of how
Information Technology is required to collate, analyse and distribute genetic
data \cite{tavani2006ethics}[Chp.~17].

The abundance of data available in the form of genetic and image data raises
concerns for privacy of individuals. The fact that Informatics has come to
play such a critical role in biomedical research poses problems ethically.
Fields such as Bioethics and Computational ethics have had years to develop
independently.

Hongladarom argues that Bioinformatics poses a whole new paradigm of ethics in
terms of data protection. While data protection measures are in place for the
safe keeping of credit card numbers in order to protect the identity of an
individual, storing a persons full genome or exome sequence adds an additional
challenge in that your genetic sequence is inherently and indelibly part of
your identity \cite{hongladarom2006ethics}.

This article will expand on some of the ethical challenges that come with
Bioimaging and Bioinformatics with particular attention given to the storing
of data and tissue in Biobanks, followed by a discussion of the ethics of
image manipulation in a scientific context.
